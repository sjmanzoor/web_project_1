# Web Project 1: Learning How to Learn
## Project Description:
Over the course of a couple of sprints, we were tasked to create a fully-functioning, standard, single-page website based around our knowledge of HTML and CSS.
## Techniques Used:
Besides basic HTML and CSS, we worked with BEM methodology to structure our files and folders, vendor prefixes, flexbox, positioning, making our code compatible across browsers (and accessible to more users), animations, transitions, embedding videos-- all while following our project brief. I plan to add on to this landing page the more I learn.
